    "# Welcome to the WEIS Workshop - Chapter 3: Design Load Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "We've successfully developed a complete 20MW floating wind turbine system:\n",
    "- **Chapter 1**: Optimized rotor design using WISDEM\n",
    "- **Chapter 2**: Re-tuned controller and optimized platform using RAFT and OpenFAST\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter 3: Design Load Cases (DLC) Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we validate our design using industry-standard Design Load Cases (DLCs). This ensures our optimized system meets safety and performance requirements under all operational and extreme conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We'll Cover\n",
    "- **Load Analysis**: Using WEIS to generate a subset of DLCs for our floating wind turbine\n",
    "- **Running Simulations**: Execute the DLCs using OpenFAST, with WEIS handling the file generation, parallelization, and postprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: DLC simulations are computationally expensive (~hours per case), so we'll analyze precomputed results that demonstrate the complete validation workflow."
