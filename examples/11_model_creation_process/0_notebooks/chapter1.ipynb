    "# Welcome to the WEIS Workshop - Chapter 1: Rotor Design and Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "WEIS is a comprehensive framework that performs multifidelity co-design of wind turbines by integrating multiple NREL-developed tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **WISDEM** (Wind-Plant Integrated System Design and Engineering Model) - A set of models for assessing overall wind plant cost of energy (COE) using wind turbine and plant cost, energy production, and financial models\n",
    "- **OpenFAST** - A physics-based engineering tool for simulating the coupled dynamic response of wind turbines, including aero-hydro-servo-elastic simulation in the time domain\n",
    "- **ROSCO** (Reference OpenSource Controller) - An open, modular, and fully adaptable baseline wind turbine controller with industry-standard functionality\n",
    "- **RAFT** (Response Amplitudes of Floating Turbines) - A frequency-domain analysis tool for floating wind turbines\n",
    "\n",
    "These tools work together in a unique workflow to enable comprehensive wind turbine design optimization, from individual components to full system integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workshop Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, you are tasked with designing and optimizing a **20MW floating wind turbine** starting from the IEA 22MW reference turbine. Your objectives include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Establish baseline performance** - Understand the IEA 22MW floating turbine characteristics and performance\n",
    "2. **Scale and optimize the rotor** - Modify the rotor to achieve 20MW rating while optimizing aerodynamic and structural performance\n",
    "3. **Optimize the controller** - Retune the ROSCO pitch controller for the new rotor design to ensure optimal performance\n",
    "4. **Design the floating platform** - Optimize a semisubmersible platform to support the turbine under various load conditions\n",
    "5. **Validate through load analysis** - Simulate the design according to IEC Design Load Case (DLC) analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our Systematic Multi-Stage Approach \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll follow a systematic optimization approach that mirrors our wind turbine development practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **IEA 22MW Baseline** - Start with the IEA 22MW floating turbine to establish a reference point\n",
    "2. **Rotor Scaling and Optimization** - Scale the rotor diameter for 20MW rating, then optimize chord, twist, and structural properties using WISDEM\n",
    "3. **Controller Re-tuning** - Use ROSCO to re-tune the controller for optimal performance with the modified rotor\n",
    "4. **Floating Platform Optimization** - Use RAFT for frequency-domain optimization of the semisubmersible platform\n",
    "5. **High-Fidelity Integration** - Refine the design using OpenFAST for coupled aero-hydro-servo-elastic optimization\n",
    "6. **Design Validation** - Conduct comprehensive DLC analysis to verify the final design meets all requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- This staged approach offers several advantages:\n",
    "- **Manageable complexity** - Build complexity gradually rather than solving one massive optimization problem\n",
    "- **Appropriate fidelity** - Use the right tool for each design phase (fast tools for initial sizing, high-fidelity for final validation)\n",
    "- **Better convergence** - Smaller, focused optimization problems are more likely to converge successfully\n",
    "- **Educational value** - Understand how different subsystems interact and influence overall performanc -->\n"

    "- **Turbine Scaling**: Modified the IEA 22MW design to create a 20MW turbine by adjusting rotor diameter and rated power\n",
    "- **Rotor Optimization**: Used WISDEM to optimize chord distribution, structural properties, and airfoil positioning\n",
    "- **Convergence Analysis**: Examined the optimization history using log_opt.sql and plotted convergence behavior\n",
